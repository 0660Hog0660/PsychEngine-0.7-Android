![](https://i.imgur.com/h6Ja7eT.png)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

Story mode menu rework:

* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

A Credits menu
![](https://i.imgur.com/NdIQt3d.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)

Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Controls and Preferences there, not much to say about it. Go check it yourself k?

Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, it plays the note hit animation on their strum, just like when the player hits a note.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song on Freeplay by pressing Space once.

Dialogue file:
* Example:
```
psychic:left bf:right
:0:talk:0.05:normal:What brings you here so late at night?
:1:talk:0.05:normal:Beep.
:0:angry:0.05:angry:Drop the act already.
:0:unamused:0.05:normal:I could feel your malicious intent the\nmoment you stepped foot in here.
:1:talk:0.05:normal:Bep bee aa skoo dep?
:0:talk:0.05:normal:I wouldn't try the door if I were you.
:0:unamused:0.05:normal:Now...
:0:talk:0.05:normal:I have a couple of questions to ask you...
:0:angry:0.1:normal:And you WILL answer them.
```

* The first line will define the characters you will use on the dialogue
  * First value is the character
  * Second value is the character's position ("left", "center" or "right")
  * You separate the characters by adding a space between them
  * It's important that you keep in mind their creation order, as it will be used on the dialogue lines's first value

* Dialogue lines must start with a `:` and every value is separated by another `:`, the values are in the respective order:
  * Character speaking's ID (Based on character creation order)
  * Animation to use during this line
  * Text speed, default is 0.05 (20 characters per second)
  * Speech bubble type ("normal" or "angry")
  * Text. Warning! Don't use this kind of quote: `â€™`, use this instead: `'`
